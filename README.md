# 📄 Invoice Extraction via Telegram Webhook (ERPNext)

A fully automated system to extract invoice data by sending files to a Telegram bot.  
Invoices are received via **Telegram Webhook**, stored in **ERPNext**, processed using **Gemini AI**, and saved as **Extracted Invoice** documents.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Send invoice files (PDF / JPG / PNG) via Telegram
- Automatic file saving in ERPNext File Manager
- Automatic creation of **Extracted Invoice**
- AI-based data extraction (supplier, items, tax, totals)
- Webhook-based (no polling, no manual buttons)
- Ready to convert into Purchase Invoice

---

## 🧱 Requirements

- ERPNext / Frappe Framework
- App: `invoice_extraction_app`
- Telegram Bot
- Public HTTPS URL (ngrok or real domain)

{
  "ok": true,
  "description": "Webhook was set"
}
```

```

---

## 8️⃣ Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue                         | Solution             |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Webhook not working           | Re-run setup_webhook |
| Invoice created without data  | Check Gemini API key |
| Mandatory original_file error | File download failed |
| Bot not responding            | Verify Chat ID       |
| ngrok URL changed             | Re-set webhook       |

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

* Admin Chat ID restricts access to one chat
* Webhook accepts only Telegram IPs
* No polling = better performance

---

## 📦 Production Notes

* ngrok URLs change on restart (free plan)
* For production, use a real domain
* Webhook must always point to HTTPS

---

## ✅ System Status

✔ Webhook only
✔ No polling
✔ No manual UI dependency
✔ Fully automated

---
